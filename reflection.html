		<h2>Reflective Portfolio</h2>
		
		<p> I am a master's student and this is second time I am learning Website Development. I thought I knew everything about developing websites as I made an online shopping webbsite in my undergraduation. <br>
		But I am really glad that I took this course again because I have learned lot of different things and aspects used in developing website, which were not taught in my undergrades such as keeping consistancy in design and looks among all pages of the website. I also learned using concept of VARK in the website so that the website can be more interactive and can target wide range of audience. I have also learned the difference between good and bad web design, error free code for better compatiblity with browsers. I came across some attractive features like designing photo gallery, storyboard, vedio editing, rss feeds etc. <br>
		I feel really confident but I won't stop learning new techniques and modify my website.
